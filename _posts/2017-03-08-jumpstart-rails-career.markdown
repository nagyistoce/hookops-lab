If you're struggling to market yourself as a qualified candidate seeking a full-time Rails developer position, you're about to uncover one of most effective strategies for breaking into the software development industry.

Because you're reading this, there's good chance you're currently in one of these situations...

1. You just started learning Rails and aim to become a professional developer within a years time.

2. You've been searching and a lot of the junior developer jobs require 2-3 of years of professional experience.

3. You've been applying to various Rails job adverts for the last couple of months and you haven't had much luck getting responses.

4. Sometimes you ask yourself: Is Ruby & Rails worth learning today, in terms of making money in the future?

Because you've done everything you've been told...

1. You've contributed to existing open source projects or uploaded all your projects to GitHub, but clients and employers aren't fighting each other to work with you.

2. You've attended meetups (i.e networking events) and all you've got to show for it is a pile of business cards and unreturned emails.

3. You've started a technical blog, but the comments section is full of thank-yous, but no offers because busy business people who could hire you don't read your blog yet.

4. You have a mentor, for pair-programming, code review and coaching...

And still, every time you apply for a Rails developer position, you get the silent treatment. Or the [standardized email for rejected candidates](http://blog.openviewpartners.com/candidate-rejections-process/):

> “Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Rails developer opening at Company X. Unfortunately, we have decided to move forward with another candidate who had more experience.”

It's about time you kick "lack of experience" where it hurts and get paid to use Ruby & Rails...even if you don't have a college education. You'll get hired and paid to use Ruby & Rails without hustling (too much).

You don't have to add React, EmberJS and AngularJS to your skillsets because you'll get hired using ONLY your current Ruby & Rails skills.

If you've taught yourself Ruby and Rails the hard way and you've read any these books (including other resources)...

+ Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl
+ Agile Web Development With Rails 5 by Sam Ruby
+ Beginning Ruby by Peter Cooper
+ Ruby on Rails 4.0 Guide by Stephan Wintermeyer
+ Learn Ruby on Rails by Daniel Kehoe
+ Programming Ruby 1.9 & 2.0 by The Pragmatic Programmers
+ many parts of the official Rails Guide

Then the next thing you need is a way to feed your dream client or employer so that you can also break into the software development industry.

You need a service you can sell to your first or next client...and then leverage that into more opportunities, whether that's a full-time position at one company or multiple freelance clients.

You need a service clients will happily purchase from you to achieve their desired business goals sooner.

The biggest obstacle I faced after learning Ruby and Rails was knowing exactly how to stand out from the horde of Ruby and Rails developers out there.

I needed to give potential clients a reason to hire me instead of the next developer, who has more experience and a killer client roster.

So, I spent a better part of a year (and mucho dinero) attending workshops to learn how to design and sell productized consulting services, consistently and predictably.

What I've learned has given me the opportunity serve clients like Hubstaff, Wootric, ConvertKit and HeyUpdate...in the last 6 months alone.

And that's exactly what I'm going condense and show in the next 7 days. You'll know how you can also use the briefcase technique plus the "stairstep" approach to land your first freelance-consulting client, then leverage that into bigger or better opportunities.
