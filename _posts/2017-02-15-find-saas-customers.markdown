Right at this very moment, there is someone visiting your website. But they’re not just any visitor. This is a targeted visitor, someone who's very interested in what you’re selling. They’re looking over your offers. They’re reading your blog. They’re clicking on your links.

And then…they click off your page. 

They may have the best intention of coming back – maybe they even bookmarked your site – but once they leave your site, their enthusiasm fades as fast as fireworks in a thunderstorm.

You’re going to lose a good prospect forever.

Now, most SaaS developer and marketers know that they should try to capture their visitors onto a mailing list, which is why they have opt-in forms all over the website.

That’s a good thing. But many of these same marketers just let visitors slip away once they click the “back” button or otherwise try to leave the site.

And that’s a mistake. You see, just because someone didn’t buy something or even join your list when they first arrived on your site doesn’t mean “no” forever. That’s why you need to give them a last-chance opportunity to say “yes” to an offer, such as a free lead-magnet product.

Think about it…

When the visitor first arrived on your site, they didn’t join your list because you hadn’t yet built value and showed them you’re worth listening to.

So just because you offered something before and they didn’t take it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t offer it to them again as they’re leaving. If you put the right offer in front of your exit traffic, you might just end up with an eye-popping conversion rate.

So that leads to this first question…

#### **What is the right offer?**

Most SaaS marketers put the same lead magnet in front of all their visitors. Sure, that will pull in a few subscribers. But if you really want a conversion rate that’s off the charts, then you need to give your exiting visitors an offer that’s directly related to whatever it is they were just viewing.

For example, if your visitor was just looking at your sales page for user onboarding training videos, then you can offer them one video for free if they join your list.

Or if your visitor was reading a blog post about SaaS pricing training, then offer them a free report on the same topic. Point is, the more targeted your offer is, the better your conversion rate.

Now the next question…

#### **How do you “capture” exit traffic?**

Redirecting exiting traffic to a special offer sounds a bit technical, right? Well the good news is that it’s a lot easier than you think, especially if you follow these three steps…

*Step 1 – Set up a professional lead page.*

For this step you need an autoresponder (such as Drip, GetResponse, MailChimp or any other reputable email service provider), and a web page to showcase your offer and opt-in form.

If you’re not exactly a word class web designer, no worries – you can still set up a great-looking lead page with just a couple clicks of your mouse. Checkout Leadpages for more details.

*Step 2 – Choose a targeted offer.*

As mentioned above, you’ll get a much higher conversion rate if you create multiple offers and then send your traffic to the offers most related to what they were just viewing.

Just be sure your lead magnet product is valuable, it’s something your visitors really want, and it’s something that will lead to a paid product purchase. 

*Step 3 – Redirect visitors.*

Now here’s what most people think is the tricky part – how do you redirect exiting visitors to your lead page? The good news is you don’t need to create any code or have any technical experience.

Just use CatchaMonkey, which will handle all the redirects for you. It’s pretty darn easy.

And now the next question...

#### **Are you making these traffic and conversion mistakes?**

Ask just about any SaaS developer or marketer on the planet if they have enough traffic, and I bet the answer is “no.” Even the marketers who’re pulling down the huge traffic numbers want more traffic. 

And the reason is pretty simple: because more traffic equals more customers, more sales and more cash.

However, while most SaaS developers and marketers want more traffic, there’s also a good chunk of them who’re making some deadly traffic mistakes. That’s right, they’re shooting themselves in the foot and settling for a trickle of traffic when they could be so much more.

Are you making these deadly traffic and marketing mistakes too? Find out by reading on…

*Mistake 1: Cherry-picking traffic methods.*

You’ve probably read a ton of books, blog posts, articles and other materials about getting traffic. Maybe you’ve even started developing a plan for which traffic methods you’re going to use and which ones you’re going to skip.

Hold up there for a second…

If you’re completely skipping a traffic method because you think or even know that it won’t work, then that’s one thing. 

For example, trying to generate traffic from some decade-old, untargeted source like a “start page” exchange is pretty fruitless. If you read about this in some old traffic report then yeah… feel free to ignore it.

What I’m talking about are ignoring proven traffic methods that are sure to bring targeted traffic to your site.

For example:

You don’t feel like building a prospect database or publishing a resource center, because you don’t really feel like developing and committing to a publishing schedule.

You don’t want to get joint venture partners or affiliates, because you’re happier working alone.

You thumb your nose at social media, even though your target market is young and known to hang out on Facebook all day.

So what if there is a traffic method that you don’t really feel like doing? Then hire someone to do it for you. Because if you want to build a thriving business, don’t skip over a promising traffic method just because you don’t feel like doing it yourself.


*Mistake 2: Not being consistent.*

Sometimes SaaS developer and marketers start off really enthusiastic about driving traffic to their site.  They start running ads, doing content swaps, blogging, setting up a Facebook page, optimizing their pages for the search engines, setting up an affiliate program… and so on.

This goes on for a few weeks, and the traffic starts coming in at a nice clip. So when the developer marketer sees all the targeted traffic filling up his analytics dashboard, he diverts his attention and starts working on something else. 

Many SaaS marketers think that if they stop working on their marketing, that somehow the traffic will just keep coming in on its own.

Of course it doesn’t work that way.

Content swaps lose effectiveness as the content drops off the blogger’s front page.

Affiliates start to lose interest and go seek out other opportunities.

Facebook fans and blog readers drift away when they realize there hasn’t been any new content in a while.

The competitors in the search engines knock your pages out of the top spots.

And of course paid ads don’t bring in any visitors once you stop the campaigns.

So here’s the point…

If you want to keep the traffic not only coming in but building over time, you need to do something every day to increase your traffic. 

For example, you may do one or more of the following every day:

Recruit new affiliates or joint venture partners. You might make it a goal to find five new partners before the week is out.

Send an email to marketing partners. At a minimum, you can send them new tools to help their promotions, such as new ads, blog posts and graphics. If you really want to get them hopping, then send out an announcement about an upcoming affiliate contest.


Post something on your blog, on someone else’s blog, or on social media. Or do all three. Aim for something that will engage readers and start up a discussion.

Create a viral video. This could be something funny, super-useful or even controversial. Then post it on social media and see if you get any traction.

Send an email to your list. Then make it a point to do this regularly, as the only way to build a good relationship with them is by sending your list engaging content on at least a weekly basis.

Start up a Facebook ad campaign. Just be sure to use the ad platform’s power tool to get your ad in front of as targeted an audience as possible.

And so on.

In short: Small steps on a consistent basis lead to big results over time.

And now the third mistake…

*Mistake 3: Skipping tracking and testing.*

Many SaaS developer and marketers waste a lot of time and money chasing after advertising strategies that simply don’t work for them. Maybe they’re using ineffective ads or calls to action. Maybe their lead pages suck. Or maybe they’re even posting ads in places where they’re getting very little action.

Why on earth would someone keep throwing money and time at advertising that doesn’t work? imple: Because these marketers have no idea their advertising doesn’t work.

And you know what? Unless you are tracking and testing your ad campaigns, you too might be wasting a lot of money and time running lousy ads.

So what you need to do is start keeping careful track of what works and what doesn’t. You’ll need a tool to track and statistically test your ads and campaigns. You can find plenty of tools around, such as Google Analytics, or the open-source alternative at Piwik.org. 

Check your other tools, which may have built in tracking. One good example is your email service provider, as many of the big providers can track open and click-through rates.

Once you decide what you’re going to test, then be sure to test just one element of your ad campaign at a time. That way, you can be confident that any change in the conversion rate is due to that one element, rather than something else.

For example, if you’re testing the best time of the day to send emails – 9:00am or 9:00pm -- then you need to randomly split your list into two groups and send out the exact same email to both groups. 

If everything else about the emails is exactly the same, then you’ll know that any difference in conversion rate is due to the time it was sent out.

These three mistakes seem pretty simple, and yet you’ll face dismal amounts of traffic if you make these them too. So be sure to test everything, diversify your traffic methods, and take consistent steps every day to build your traffic.

Of course the question is, what else should you be doing to build traffic?
