        <title>Jumpstart Your Web Development Career</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re struggling to market yourself as a qualified candidate seeking a full-time Rails developer position, you’re about to uncover one of most effective strategies for breaking into the software development industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you’re reading this, there’s good chance you’re currently in one of these situations…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You just started learning Rails and aim to become a professional developer within a years time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ve been searching and a lot of the junior developer jobs require 2-3 of years of professional experience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ve been applying to various Rails job adverts for the last couple of months and you haven’t had much luck getting responses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sometimes you ask yourself: Is Ruby &amp;amp; Rails worth learning today, in terms of making money in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you’ve done everything you’ve been told…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ve contributed to existing open source projects or uploaded all your projects to GitHub, but clients and employers aren’t fighting each other to work with you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ve attended meetups (i.e networking events) and all you’ve got to show for it is a pile of business cards and unreturned emails.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ve started a technical blog, but the comments section is full of thank-yous, but no offers because busy business people who could hire you don’t read your blog yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have a mentor, for pair-programming, code review and coaching…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And still, every time you apply for a Rails developer position, you get the silent treatment. Or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.openviewpartners.com/candidate-rejections-process/&quot;&gt;standardized email for rejected candidates&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today about the Rails developer opening at Company X. Unfortunately, we have decided to move forward with another candidate who had more experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about time you kick “lack of experience” where it hurts and get paid to use Ruby &amp;amp; Rails…even if you don’t have a college education. You’ll get hired and paid to use Ruby &amp;amp; Rails without hustling (too much).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to add React, EmberJS and AngularJS to your skillsets because you’ll get hired using ONLY your current Ruby &amp;amp; Rails skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve taught yourself Ruby and Rails the hard way and you’ve read any these books (including other resources)…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agile Web Development With Rails 5 by Sam Ruby&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beginning Ruby by Peter Cooper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ruby on Rails 4.0 Guide by Stephan Wintermeyer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn Ruby on Rails by Daniel Kehoe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Programming Ruby 1.9 &amp;amp; 2.0 by The Pragmatic Programmers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;many parts of the official Rails Guide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the next thing you need is a way to feed your dream client or employer so that you can also break into the software development industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need a service you can sell to your first or next client…and then leverage that into more opportunities, whether that’s a full-time position at one company or multiple freelance clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need a service clients will happily purchase from you to achieve their desired business goals sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest obstacle I faced after learning Ruby and Rails was knowing exactly how to stand out from the horde of Ruby and Rails developers out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed to give potential clients a reason to hire me instead of the next developer, who has more experience and a killer client roster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I spent a better part of a year (and mucho dinero) attending workshops to learn how to design and sell productized consulting services, consistently and predictably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’ve learned has given me the opportunity serve clients like Hubstaff, Wootric, ConvertKit and HeyUpdate…in the last 6 months alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s exactly what I’m going condense and show in the next 7 days. You’ll know how you can also use the briefcase technique plus the “stairstep” approach to land your first freelance-consulting client, then leverage that into bigger or better opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-briefcase-technique-in-7-minutes&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Briefcase Technique In 7 Minutes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;http://monkeyplayr.com/playr.php?u=865&amp;amp;p=6825&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re now prepared to use the “stairstep” approach to land your first freelance-consulting client or full-time web development position. Go ahead, enroll in this 7 day email course, and I’ll show you the exact steps you need to follow in order to research and provide killers solutions to your clients: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getdrip.com/forms/39681746/submissions/new&quot; data-drip-show-form=&quot;39681746&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The “Startup Of You” On Rails.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inside this minicourse, a marketer-turned product developer reveals the &lt;strong&gt;only nine RSA skills and impact metrics&lt;/strong&gt; professional software developers focus on when building uber-profitable software products that don’t suck – hint: professional Rails developers like Fabio Akita, Ryan Bigg and Peter Cooper use these to stand out from their peers.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Practical Rails 5 App In One Hour – Part 2</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve already shown you the only five types of applications you’ll ever be tasked to build when you’re hired to create value as Ruby and Rails developer. You’ll choose a combination of these &lt;strong&gt;customer creation formulas&lt;/strong&gt; to build an application that meets your business goals…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can use Rails to build brochure sites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can use Rails to build publication sites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can use Rails to build online stores (ecommerce)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can use Rails to build consultative sites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can use Rails to build online services (SaaS apps)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/build-rails-app.html&quot;&gt;In part one of Practical Rails 5 App In One Hour&lt;/a&gt;, you setup a default Rails 5 application so let’s go ahead and add a unique feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;getting-started-with-rails-5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Started With Rails 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have cloned this repo, run this setup script to set up your machine
with the necessary dependencies to run and test this app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;% git clone git@github.com:HookOps/hubstaff-rails.git
% ./bin/setup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Postgres, etc. If not, set up
your machine with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop&quot;&gt;this script&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After setting up, you can run the application using &lt;a href=&quot;https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-local&quot;&gt;Heroku Local&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;% heroku local
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;http://monkeyplayr.com/playr.php?u=865&amp;amp;p=8589&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;using-a-ruby-api-client&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a Ruby API client&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hubstaff-ruby&lt;/code&gt; to your Gemfile and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#Gemfile&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;hubstaff-ruby&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;git: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;https://github.com/hookops/hubstaff-ruby.git&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Get your &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.hubstaff.com/my_apps&quot;&gt;HUBSTAFF_APP_TOKEN&lt;/a&gt;, and add it to your to your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Require files from the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hubstaff-ruby&lt;/code&gt; gem in your Rails environment; before you initialize
the Rails application. And then load your environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#environment.rb&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;require&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;hubstaff&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dotenv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;.env&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Rails&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;application&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;initialize!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Define your routes to handle authentication and
retrieving data from Hubstaff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#routes.rb&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/pages/integration&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;pages#integration&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#hubstaff email/password form&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/pages/integration&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;pages#integration&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;as: :integration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#process email/password&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/pages/screenshots&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;pages#screenshots&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;as: :screenshots&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#display screenshots&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;/pages/activities&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;pages#activities&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;as: :activities&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#display activities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5:&lt;/strong&gt; Define actions in your pages controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#pages_controller.rb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Hubstaff&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;HUBSTAFF_CLIENT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Hubstaff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;HUBSTAFF_APP_TOKEN&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;integration&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:hubstaff_email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;present?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:hubstaff_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;present?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#check if hubstaff email/password is submitted and grab it on post request&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@hubstaff_email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:hubstaff_email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@hubstaff_password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;params&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:hubstaff_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;authenticate_and_save_auth_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@hubstaff_email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@hubstaff_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#then authenticate and save the auth_token&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;redirect_to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;root_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;notice: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Successfully Connected To Hubstaff&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:integration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;alert: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Unable To Connect To Hubstaff&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;authenticate_and_save_auth_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client_user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;find_by_email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;HUBSTAFF_CLIENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;authenticate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@hubstaff_email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@hubstaff_password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hubstaff_auth_token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;HUBSTAFF_CLIENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;auth_token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#you&#39;ll need a migration to add hubstaff_auth_token to User model&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;save!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;screenshots&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#retrieve screenshots for display in your app&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:screenshots&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:integration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;alert: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Please Connect To Hubstaff&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;activities&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#retrieve activities for display in your app&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hubstaff_auth_token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;present?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;HUBSTAFF_CLIENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;auth_token&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;current_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hubstaff_auth_token&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@hubstaff_activities&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;HUBSTAFF_CLIENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;activities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;2016-09-29&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;2016-10-01&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;users: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;61188&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:activities&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;:integration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;alert: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Please Connect To Hubstaff&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6: [Your Turn]&lt;/strong&gt; Create forms that your users can pass the
required parameters into, so that they retrieve &amp;amp; display the exact data they
want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;guidelines&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use the following guides for getting things done, programming well, and
programming in style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/blob/master/protocol&quot;&gt;Protocol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/blob/master/best-practices&quot;&gt;Best Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/blob/master/style&quot;&gt;Style&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;deploying&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have previously run the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./bin/setup&lt;/code&gt; script,
you can deploy to staging and production with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;./bin/deploy staging
    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;./bin/deploy production&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bonus-useful-ruby-gems-every-rails-developer-should-know&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BONUS: Useful Ruby gems every Rails developer should know.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several Rails gems that will make you an extremely productive Rails developer and help you produce high quality code. These &lt;a href=&quot;https://infinum.co/the-capsized-eight/articles/a-gem-for-every-occasion-11-great-ruby-libraries-we-use-on-every-project&quot;&gt;11 Rails libraries&lt;/a&gt; and other alternatives are useful for every occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to help stakeholders make better business decisions and get a good ROI from the software you build, you must implement analytics, onboarding, and marketing automation as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For analytics, Segment.io gives you the ability to aggregate data from several analytics providers, including Mixpanel and Google Analytics. You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://robots.thoughtbot.com/segment-io-and-ruby&quot;&gt;create an analytics facade&lt;/a&gt; to pass data to Segment.io and track every user interaction in your Rails app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t just deliver a project and expect users to know how to use it on their first encounter. To improve engagement, user adoption and retention rates, you need personalized onboarding flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can  provide a better onboarding experience in your Rails app with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/appcues/appcues-rails&quot;&gt;Appcues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your Rails app is for internal use only, you don’t have to worry about marketing automation at all. When you’re working on a project that’s meant for consumers, you must implement marketing automation because the number one problem product creators face is distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three primary ways to implement marketing automation and help your business reach more potential customers is through social sharing, email marketing and built-in referrals. Integrating social sharing is easy; you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hermango/shareable&quot;&gt;shareable&lt;/a&gt; or any other social sharing Rails gem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several options for transactional emails in Rails, but I’d recommend you take a good look at those that allow you to send behavior-based messages. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/DripEmail/drip-ruby&quot;&gt;Drip&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/customerio/customerio-ruby&quot;&gt;Customer.io&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/intercom/intercom-rails&quot;&gt;Intercom&lt;/a&gt; are good options for email marketing automation in your Rails app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting your current customers to refer others to you is a great way to grow your online business. It’s easy to implement referral marketing with Ambassador, but that’s a little pricy. Alternatives for baking referrals into your Rails app include &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexlevin/rack-affiliates&quot;&gt;Rack Affiliates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/scambra/devise_invitable&quot;&gt;DeviseInvitable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, you can’t do business online without a way to accept payments. To accept payments with Stripe, you can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/peterkeen/payola&quot;&gt;Payola&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/andrewculver/koudoku&quot;&gt;Koudoku&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s still more to learn, but now that you’ve familiarize yourself with with Ruby and Rails, &lt;a href=&quot;/jumpstart-dev-career.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;use this 2-step backdoor strategy to jumpstart your web development career&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, even before you master Ruby and Rails topics, concepts and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Practical Rails 5 App In One Hour – Part 1</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s no better way to learn a new programming language, framework or skill than to apply what you’ve studied to practical projects. However, it can be difficult to find commercial projects you can work on to improve your Ruby on Rails skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s likely you’ve postponed building something tangible that you can show off to your friends and potential employers because everything becomes a slog after you’ve learned the basics of Ruby and Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, you end up reading every tutorial about the latest Ruby gems and SQL optimization techniques, making things even more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve taken Ruby on Rails courses, read dozens of books, and still feel like you need to memorize the core Ruby classes before you can call yourself a Rails developer, you’ll be pleased to know that there are just five ways to use your new found skills and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re hired as a Rails developer to create value for both offline and online businesses, there are five possible ways to achieve that. Let’s discuss the five practical Ruby on Rails projects you’ll ever be tasked to build, the stack you could use plus gems you could use to speed up your development process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;you-can-use-rails-to-build-brochure-sites&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can use Rails to build brochure sites.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses have used brochures to present themselves in various situations to prospective buyers since printers were invented. Salespeople leave them behind after a visit with a prospective buyer, send them through the mail or stuck them under windshield wipers to show their products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing that a brochure accomplishes is convince people to contact the company about their offerings. While paper brochures are limited to six panels, you can use Rails to build brochure sites with pages of information for prospective buyers to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brochure sites aren’t good at generating leads and sales for businesses, but they do a fantastic job of supporting salespeople, who can refer prospects to it to learn more about products and services. You’ll also build brochure sites to provide contact information about a company, help visitors find the location of physical stores, and establish a company’s brand image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;you-can-use-rails-to-build-publication-sites&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can use Rails to build publication sites.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical publication site offers original and curated information for prospects and customers to consume. Examples of publication sites include Mashable, Youtube and Code School. If you’ve ever built a blog with Rails, you’re already familiar with how publication sites work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They provide content in a variety of formats and media, such as text, video and audio.
The goods for sale on publication sites are either original or curated online content, and they make money through subscriptions, donations, and advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;you-can-use-rails-to-build-online-stores-ecommerce&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can use Rails to build online stores (ecommerce).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon, Etsy, eBay, information marketers and book authors use online stores to sell one or more products. Online stores (or Ecommerce sites) allow visitors to purchase a product, using any agreed-upon currency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online stores are different from publication sites and SaaS apps in that they don’t provide the product or service directly. Instead, you’d either download a digital product from an online store or get a physical product shipped to you after your purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;you-can-use-rails-to-build-consultative-sites&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can use Rails to build consultative sites.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consultative sites are built to support salespeople through long business-to-business sales cycles. They help prospective buyers educate themselves about the problems they have and the solutions available to them until they are ready to make a purchase decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll build a consultative site for a company that delivers complex or expensive products and services. When multiple people are involved in the decision to purchase a product or service, you’ll need a consultative site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your primary goal when building a consultative site is to provide guidance because it may take several days, weeks or months to sell complex offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;you-can-use-rails-to-build-online-services-saas-apps&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can use Rails to build online services (SaaS apps).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications like Pivotal Tracker, GitHub, and Basecamp were once delivered through desktop software only, but they’ve been replaced by online services you can access in your favorite browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, you can manage your finances, socialize with friends and family, organize your project ideas, and communicate with your teammates from the comfort of your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails is a perfect framework for building these kinds of online services (or SaaS apps) in almost every industry. An online service could be used by just a company’s employees or could be productized and made available to other businesses to purchase. In either case, you’re delivering a product with the online service and customers must be granted access before they can use the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;choose-your-customer-creation-formula&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Your Customer Creation Formula&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re familiar with Brian Massey’s book, &lt;em&gt;Your Customer Creation Equation&lt;/em&gt;, will recognize the practical Rails projects discussed in this article as customer creation formulas. When building a Rails application for your client or for your own business, you’ll choose the right combination of formulas to help get more leads, triers or customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right combination will depend on how the business makes money. That means for one client, you might build an online store and a publication site, and for another, you might build a SaaS app and a brochure site. Regardless of how you use Rails, you must implement specific features to turn your coffee and code into an asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let me show you how to build Ruby on Rails applications that don’t suck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;choose-your-default-rails-5-stack&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose Your Default Rails 5 Stack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons why Rails gained traction quickly is due to the default stack. New developers don’t have to make major decisions about what to include in their application’s infrastructure. That makes it easy to ship useful applications quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, as you gain experience with the framework and become more knowledgeable about what makes web applications stand the test of time, you find yourself making substitutions and additions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, Rails comes with MiniTest for testing, but you substitute that for RSpec because you can recite all the RSpec matchers in your sleep and everyone on your team already uses RSpec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means you don’t have to worry about someone breaking stuff because they don’t understand what your tests are doing. And the fact that you can compliment RSpec with Shoulda-Matchers makes it a no brainer to stick to what you already know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After shipping a few applications, you realize that you always include the same gems as part of your set up process, even before you start working on the core functionality of the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually you become frustrated with your setup process because you keep doing the same thing over and over. Although you prefer your application a certain way, you can’t stand spending an entire day making things just right before you get to the fun part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the name of productivity, you start looking for a better way to bootstrap new Rails applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can set up your Rails app the same way every time &lt;a href=&quot;http://everydayrails.com/2011/02/28/rails-3-application-templates.html&quot;&gt;using a template&lt;/a&gt; that meets only your preferences. Or you can learn to use another stack that’s not an exact match for your preferences, but good enough to get the job done with minor tweaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I prefer to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thoughtbot/suspenders&quot;&gt;Suspenders&lt;/a&gt; to bootstrap new Rails applications instead of creating my own template mainly because it’s maintained by a team that’s well respected in the Rails community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t need any convincing that using Suspenders is better than creating and maintaining your own template once you take a look at Suspenders’ Gemfile and README.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I started using Suspenders, it never occurred to me that I needed a staging environment. I’d just deploy the application into production after completing a major feature, only to find that something that worked on my machine doesn’t work in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I started using a staging environment, I always get a chance to fix things before the end users are exposed to the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Suspenders comes with Dotenv for loading environment variables, which prevents you from accidentally exposing credentials for external services; you also get Web Console for better debugging via an in-browser IRB console; all of which are already configured and ready to go when you generate a new Rails app with Suspenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d bet none of the tutorials you completed while learning Rails mentioned the importance of integrating analytics tools into every Rails apps you work on. I didn’t think about that until I saw Segment listed as one of the goodies included in Suspenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course Suspenders has more to it than the things I’ve mentioned above. But I wanted to highlight those because they are the things I initially overlooked when learning and working with Rails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;getting-started-with-suspenders&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting started with Suspenders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem install suspenders&lt;/code&gt; to install the gem or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem update suspenders&lt;/code&gt; to grab the latest version if you have an older one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already have an older version installed, so I’ll update and then delete the previous one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;localhost% &lt;/span&gt;gem update suspenders

Fetching: suspenders-1.25.0.gem &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;100%&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
...
Gems updated: suspenders
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;localhost% &lt;/span&gt;gem uninstall suspenders

Select gem to uninstall:
 1. suspenders-1.21.0
 2. suspenders-1.25.0
 3. All versions
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;1
Successfully uninstalled suspenders-1.21.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now choose a name for your project, then run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;suspenders projectname&lt;/code&gt;. That will create a Rails app in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;projectname&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;localhost% &lt;/span&gt;suspenders messenger

Congratulations! You just pulled our suspenders.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll most likely have a problem with connecting to PostgresSQL during the creation of your Rails app; make sure you have PostgresSQL installed and running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even then, you still need to provide a username and password for connecting to Postgres, otherwise &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;db:create&lt;/code&gt; won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use Dotenv to supply those credentials, along with a secret token.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;localhost% &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ./messenger
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;localhost% &lt;/span&gt;touch .env.development
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;localhost% &lt;/span&gt;rake secret&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.env.development&lt;/code&gt; and add your configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;table style=&quot;border-spacing: 0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;gutter gl&quot; style=&quot;text-align: right&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;SECRET_KEY_BASE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;ea9d0bb08026b291630018ad7ee61f8ca277590302abf424bae835b27fe7ae9da776a4f59aadb5df47438a32d67ee362409a22abf4c575e1e9248f51a08061c2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;DB_USERNAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rkcudjoe&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;DB_PASSWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;devrkcudjoe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then update &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;database.yml&lt;/code&gt; with your password and username as such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#config/database.yml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%= ENV[&quot;DB_USERNAME&quot;] %&amp;gt;
password: &amp;lt;%=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;DB_PASSWORD&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, create your developement and test databases, run a migration for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;delayed_job&lt;/code&gt; and restart your server. You should see the Rails welcome page on port 5000 after that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;localhost% &lt;/span&gt;rake db:create:all
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;localhost% &lt;/span&gt;rake db:migrate
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;localhost% &lt;/span&gt;foreman start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve setup your Rails 5 stack, why don’t you go ahead and move on to part two where you’ll &lt;a href=&quot;/rails-with-suspenders.html&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;build a practical Rails 5 app, using Suspenders stack and other useful Ruby and Rails gems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Find Uber-Profitable SaaS Customers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Right at this very moment, there is someone visiting your website. But they’re not just any visitor. This is a targeted visitor, someone who’s very interested in what you’re selling. They’re looking over your offers. They’re reading your blog. They’re clicking on your links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then…they click off your page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They may have the best intention of coming back – maybe they even bookmarked your site – but once they leave your site, their enthusiasm fades as fast as fireworks in a thunderstorm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re going to lose a good prospect forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, most SaaS developer and marketers know that they should try to capture their visitors onto a mailing list, which is why they have opt-in forms all over the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a good thing. But many of these same marketers just let visitors slip away once they click the “back” button or otherwise try to leave the site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s a mistake. You see, just because someone didn’t buy something or even join your list when they first arrived on your site doesn’t mean “no” forever. That’s why you need to give them a last-chance opportunity to say “yes” to an offer, such as a free lead-magnet product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the visitor first arrived on your site, they didn’t join your list because you hadn’t yet built value and showed them you’re worth listening to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So just because you offered something before and they didn’t take it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t offer it to them again as they’re leaving. If you put the right offer in front of your exit traffic, you might just end up with an eye-popping conversion rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that leads to this first question…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-the-right-offer&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the right offer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most SaaS marketers put the same lead magnet in front of all their visitors. Sure, that will pull in a few subscribers. But if you really want a conversion rate that’s off the charts, then you need to give your exiting visitors an offer that’s directly related to whatever it is they were just viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if your visitor was just looking at your sales page for user onboarding training videos, then you can offer them one video for free if they join your list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or if your visitor was reading a blog post about SaaS pricing training, then offer them a free report on the same topic. Point is, the more targeted your offer is, the better your conversion rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the next question…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;how-do-you-capture-exit-traffic&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you “capture” exit traffic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Redirecting exiting traffic to a special offer sounds a bit technical, right? Well the good news is that it’s a lot easier than you think, especially if you follow these three steps…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 1 – Set up a professional lead page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this step you need an autoresponder (such as Drip, GetResponse, MailChimp or any other reputable email service provider), and a web page to showcase your offer and opt-in form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not exactly a word class web designer, no worries – you can still set up a great-looking lead page with just a couple clicks of your mouse. Checkout Leadpages for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 2 – Choose a targeted offer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, you’ll get a much higher conversion rate if you create multiple offers and then send your traffic to the offers most related to what they were just viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just be sure your lead magnet product is valuable, it’s something your visitors really want, and it’s something that will lead to a paid product purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step 3 – Redirect visitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here’s what most people think is the tricky part – how do you redirect exiting visitors to your lead page? The good news is you don’t need to create any code or have any technical experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just use CatchaMonkey, which will handle all the redirects for you. It’s pretty darn easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now the next question…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;are-you-making-these-traffic-and-conversion-mistakes&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you making these traffic and conversion mistakes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask just about any SaaS developer or marketer on the planet if they have enough traffic, and I bet the answer is “no.” Even the marketers who’re pulling down the huge traffic numbers want more traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the reason is pretty simple: because more traffic equals more customers, more sales and more cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while most SaaS developers and marketers want more traffic, there’s also a good chunk of them who’re making some deadly traffic mistakes. That’s right, they’re shooting themselves in the foot and settling for a trickle of traffic when they could be so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you making these deadly traffic and marketing mistakes too? Find out by reading on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mistake 1: Cherry-picking traffic methods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably read a ton of books, blog posts, articles and other materials about getting traffic. Maybe you’ve even started developing a plan for which traffic methods you’re going to use and which ones you’re going to skip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hold up there for a second…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re completely skipping a traffic method because you think or even know that it won’t work, then that’s one thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, trying to generate traffic from some decade-old, untargeted source like a “start page” exchange is pretty fruitless. If you read about this in some old traffic report then yeah… feel free to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m talking about are ignoring proven traffic methods that are sure to bring targeted traffic to your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t feel like building a prospect database or publishing a resource center, because you don’t really feel like developing and committing to a publishing schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t want to get joint venture partners or affiliates, because you’re happier working alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You thumb your nose at social media, even though your target market is young and known to hang out on Facebook all day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what if there is a traffic method that you don’t really feel like doing? Then hire someone to do it for you. Because if you want to build a thriving business, don’t skip over a promising traffic method just because you don’t feel like doing it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mistake 2: Not being consistent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes SaaS developer and marketers start off really enthusiastic about driving traffic to their site.  They start running ads, doing content swaps, blogging, setting up a Facebook page, optimizing their pages for the search engines, setting up an affiliate program… and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This goes on for a few weeks, and the traffic starts coming in at a nice clip. So when the developer marketer sees all the targeted traffic filling up his analytics dashboard, he diverts his attention and starts working on something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many SaaS marketers think that if they stop working on their marketing, that somehow the traffic will just keep coming in on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it doesn’t work that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content swaps lose effectiveness as the content drops off the blogger’s front page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Affiliates start to lose interest and go seek out other opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook fans and blog readers drift away when they realize there hasn’t been any new content in a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competitors in the search engines knock your pages out of the top spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course paid ads don’t bring in any visitors once you stop the campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the point…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep the traffic not only coming in but building over time, you need to do something every day to increase your traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you may do one or more of the following every day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recruit new affiliates or joint venture partners. You might make it a goal to find five new partners before the week is out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send an email to marketing partners. At a minimum, you can send them new tools to help their promotions, such as new ads, blog posts and graphics. If you really want to get them hopping, then send out an announcement about an upcoming affiliate contest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post something on your blog, on someone else’s blog, or on social media. Or do all three. Aim for something that will engage readers and start up a discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a viral video. This could be something funny, super-useful or even controversial. Then post it on social media and see if you get any traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send an email to your list. Then make it a point to do this regularly, as the only way to build a good relationship with them is by sending your list engaging content on at least a weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start up a Facebook ad campaign. Just be sure to use the ad platform’s power tool to get your ad in front of as targeted an audience as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: Small steps on a consistent basis lead to big results over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now the third mistake…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mistake 3: Skipping tracking and testing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many SaaS developer and marketers waste a lot of time and money chasing after advertising strategies that simply don’t work for them. Maybe they’re using ineffective ads or calls to action. Maybe their lead pages suck. Or maybe they’re even posting ads in places where they’re getting very little action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why on earth would someone keep throwing money and time at advertising that doesn’t work? imple: Because these marketers have no idea their advertising doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you know what? Unless you are tracking and testing your ad campaigns, you too might be wasting a lot of money and time running lousy ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what you need to do is start keeping careful track of what works and what doesn’t. You’ll need a tool to track and statistically test your ads and campaigns. You can find plenty of tools around, such as Google Analytics, or the open-source alternative at Piwik.org.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check your other tools, which may have built in tracking. One good example is your email service provider, as many of the big providers can track open and click-through rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you decide what you’re going to test, then be sure to test just one element of your ad campaign at a time. That way, you can be confident that any change in the conversion rate is due to that one element, rather than something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you’re testing the best time of the day to send emails – 9:00am or 9:00pm – then you need to randomly split your list into two groups and send out the exact same email to both groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything else about the emails is exactly the same, then you’ll know that any difference in conversion rate is due to the time it was sent out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three mistakes seem pretty simple, and yet you’ll face dismal amounts of traffic if you make these them too. So be sure to test everything, diversify your traffic methods, and take consistent steps every day to build your traffic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course the question is, what else should you be doing to build traffic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another one: what is the best way to bring in targeted traffic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answers to these questions can make or break your SaaS business, which is why you should &lt;a href=&quot;https://rkcudjoe.withcoach.com/predictable-hook-triggers.html&quot;&gt;get your answers from old-school SaaS marketers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Ways Dropouts Succeed With Rails</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;How do Rails pros convey that they don’t just know their way around Ruby and Rails projects, but they can also be of value when it comes to solving expensive business problems with software?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do professional software developers jump ahead from their current position WITHOUT being “language agnostic” and learning half-dozen other programming languages, just in case a potential client (or full-time employer) needed it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don’t know, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/&quot;&gt;allow me to summarize what I learned&lt;/a&gt; from Patrick McKenzie, Godfather of the Internet (Currently @ Atlas by Stripe).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby and Rails developers who’re able to create a remarkable career in software development focus on JUST THREE THINGS, the same three things that drive most hiring and promotion decisions at business of all sizes, including startups and F500 companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ruby / Rails developer who’re able to stand out from their peers focus on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping businesses satisfy a need for their customers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solve an expensive, internal business problems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And capitalize on an in emerging business opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at three examples of how this plays out in the real-world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;satisfying-a-need-for-their-customer--marketplace&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 – Satisfying a need for their customer / marketplace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know that the average Staff Software Engineer at Walmart, the lowest ranked developers, earns $151, 283 per year? Walmart spends a fortune on these developers NOT because they’re better than other developers out there.
Instead, their main responsibilities, which includes optimizing their ecommerce web app so that it becomes a machine that turns casual browsers into buyers is very important to both Walmart and the people who buy from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the “business folks” at Walmart are experts in the brick-and-mortar business, their customers appreciate an ecommerce site that works 24/7/367. Hence, Walmart hires these developers and spends a fortune on them to satisfy that need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t make sense from the outside looking in, but I’m sure they’ve done the math and know that they can provide a lot more variety of products to their customers through their ecommerce site, and at more profitable margins, just like Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what product or service a business sells, they’d hire a developer to build a website to peddle their wares because their customers and marketplace prefer to purchase products online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An expert Rails developer understands this and makes that crystal clear to their potential client (or full-time employer), instead of selling themselves based on only the tech stack they’re familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;solve-expensive-internal-business-problems&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 – Solve expensive, internal business problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortune 500 companies subscribe to Salesforce and spend, on average, $114,000 per year on Salesforce Consultants to customize the software because they want to find more customers, close more deals faster and keep customers happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unhappy customers and slow sales-cycles are expensives problem for almost every B2B company, including Fortune 500 companies. A spreadsheet could do the same job as a CRM, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a spreadsheet simply can’t solve the problem of keeping customers happy. 
That’s why Salesforce exits. And thousands of Salesforce Consultants focus exclusively on adding new features to system to help sales teams meet their quota, and improve the overall bottom line of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also build a remarkable career as Ruby / Rails developer, if you focus on building software that helps businesses solve problems like keeping customers happy, consistently meeting sales quotas, and improving the overall bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;capitalize-on-an-emerging-profitable-business-opportunity&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 – Capitalize on an emerging, profitable business opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basecamp, Shopify and GitHub created software to capitalize on business opportunities. Entrepreneurs and startups build software products because they want to capitalize on an opportunity before another person does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It happens that most startups today use Ruby and Rails because if it’s good enough for Basecamp, Shopify and GitHub, it must be good enough for them too. There’s no point in reinventing the wheel or betting their livelihood and future on an unproven JS framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rails is popular among entrepreneurs/startups because they can build MVPs quickly and bring their products and services to market faster to capitalize on an emerging  opportunity before a competitor does. That’s why the average Ruby and Rails developer in NYC, who works at an early stage startups takes home $78,614 per year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could build software for a Fortune 500, a non-profit organization, or a small startup in the middle of nowhere. It doesn’t matter where, or for whom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be doing it for one or more of these reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Satisfying a need for their customers / marketplace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solving an expensive, internal business problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capitalizing on an emerging, profitable opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took me more than TWO YEARS to internalize this, so don’t blame yourself if other Ruby / Rails educators haven’t taught you this. Perhaps, they don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had I known this sooner, I would have spent more time to learn how to turn business problems, needs and opportunities into working software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had I known sooner that businesses hire software developers to build Ruby / Rails applications to satisfy a need, solve a problem, or capitalize on an opportunity…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…I would have learned how to build robust, and secure software, that’s easily maintainable and uber-profitable sooner, not just working software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t have wasted time trying to understand how Rails internals work (I still don’t), how to implement authentication from scratch in Rails or the 7 different ways you can deploy and backup a Rails application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t have worried about which Ruby gem I should learn to use next so that I’m employable. And I wouldn’t have worried about memorizing Sandi Metz’s rules for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s because I would’ve taught myself almost everything I ever needed to know about building software with Ruby and Rails, in the process of building valuable and working software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I did, as soon as I stopped focusing on the tools of the trade – HTML/CSS, Ruby and Rails, JavaScript/CoffeeScript, and PostgreSQL – and started putting on a “business analyst hat” when deciding what topics I should learn next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not telling you this to brag, but to impress upon you that understanding the business of software development helps you focus on the right things when approaching potential clients (or full-time employer) for work and figuring out how to demonstrate the value you provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also build a remarkable career in software development and jump ahead from your current position…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WITHOUT worrying about when you’ll be good enough
WITHOUT learning through career-killing trial-and-error
WITHOUT become “language agnostic” for a rainy day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m going to show you how to MODEL the way you create software after some of the great minds in this profession, including Ryan Bigg, DHH and Fabio Akita.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’e already shown you the ONLY THREE THINGS you should focus on as a Ruby / Rails developer who wants to show the value you can provide so that you can also create a remarkable career in software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you’ve forgotten (or skipped that section) it’s the same three things that drives hiring and promotion decisions at almost every business, including F500 companies and growth-stage startups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter if you’re a solo-consultant or looking for your next full-time position, you’ll be hired or promoted based on whether you can build software that helps the client (or full-time employer) achieve these business objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Satisfy a need for their customers / marketplace&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Solve an expensive, internal business problem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capitalize on an emerging, profitable opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you determine the WHY behind a particular software you’re working on, the next step is to capture the requirements for the solution you plan to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to structure your software delivery process. This is the exact process used by Ruby and Rails developers you admire, including DHH, Peter Cooper and Fabio Akita, to ship uber-profitable software products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&quot;http://monkeyplayr.com/playr.php?u=865&amp;amp;p=9349&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Need/Problem/Opportunity → User Stories → Requirement Specification → Technical Specification → Implementation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you write a single line of code, you must wear your “business analyst hat” and create a requirement specification for the software solution you intend to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your requirement specifications should always be clear and testable, so one of the best ways to make sure you always build valuable, and easily maintainable software is to write your requirement specifications as user stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the most common web app functionality, and write a clear and testable requirement specification as user stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead of writing:&lt;/em&gt; Sign In Functionality Required&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professional Rails developers write:&lt;/em&gt; As a customer, I want to sign in using my username and password, so that I can check my order history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of using user stories to write clear and testable requirement specifications is that you always fit your requirements into a format everyone involved in the project can understand, including non-technical “business people.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a [STAKEHOLDER], I want to [GOAL], so that [MOTIVATION]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The [STAKEHOLDER] describes whom you’re implementing a feature for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The [GOAL] describes what the stakeholder does with a feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The [MOTIVATION] describes why the stakeholder wants that feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the previous example again, with each component of the user story identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a customer [STAKEHOLDER], I want to sign in using my username and password [GOAL], so that a can review my order history [MOTIVATION].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you write requirement specifications as user stories, you focus on the people who will use the software you build, instead of the exact solutions and the technology stack that you’ll use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also makes you think more logically and strategically about the complex problem you’ve been tasked to solve, so that you can build valuable and working software for your clients (or full-time employer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you know professional Rails developers use stories to ship secure and robust software that’s valuable and uber-profitable, how can you take this knowledge and make it a core part of your own software development process?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re drawing blanks right now, don’t fret because I’ve got your back. Just use the user stories and test cases written in RSPEC below…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And ship TWO Ruby apps tonight: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.getdrip.com/forms/51176020/submissions/new&quot; data-drip-show-form=&quot;51176020&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download my RSpec test cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>3 Deadly Sins SaaS Developers Avoid</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last 4+ years, I’ve studied dozens of successful product launches from founders who bootstrapped their SaaS products, documented the most effective online sales and marketing strategies, and learned about the unique challenges of shipping SaaS apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the number #1 challenge that product creators face is having a pipeline of sales qualified leads because they’ve built a product that their customers don’t want to buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why in this article, you’ll discover:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 5 common software delivery problems and how to solve them to reduce waste.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The 4 questions that founding teams must agree on before committing to projects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to make better roadmap decisions and align your activities to business goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll start delivering business goals with your software, not just features, from day one. And you’ll avoid failure as a developer tasked with building software that’s profitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;common-software-planning-and-delivery-problems&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Common software planning and delivery problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can correct me if I’m wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s only one reason businesses build software, whether they are startups or good ‘ol boring entrenched businesses. That reason is to help them achieve a clearly defined business goal: generate more revenue and/or reduce operational costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can always trace feature requests by stakeholders back to a desire to increase revenue and lower operating costs, regardless of the current stage of the business. You implement features as the mechanism that’ll drive you towards the business goals you’ve identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter whether it’s a commercial or internal product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d make pages load fast because you don’t want your customers to get frustrated and switch to a competitor, which means lower revenues for your software business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d create software to automate processes because you believe it’ll increase productivity, helping your team focus on higher-value revenue generating activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’d use off-the-shelf software and tools like Rails because you believe it will help bring your product to market faster, which translates into revenue for your business sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, most software products fail to help businesses achieve their goals, especially early-stage startups that are introducing new products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CB Insights analyzed 101 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbinsights.com/blog/startup-failure-reasons-top/&quot;&gt;startup failure post-mortems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess what the #1 reason failed startups cited as the cause of their demise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not because they couldn’t build the product (not cited as a reason for failure).&lt;br /&gt;
It’s not because they couldn’t find a business model (the #7 reason for failure).&lt;br /&gt;
It’s not because they run out of cash (the #2 reason for failure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Market Need.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The #1 reason startups fail is building a solution looking for a problem to solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All failed startups were able to release their product, but not enough people needed it, so they couldn’t find customers who were willing to pay a fair price to use the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your first order of business as a SaaS developer is to ensure that the products you build helps businesses achieve their desired goals: solve real problems for customers so that you can generate revenue or reduce costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, knowing that you must solve real problems in order to achieve your business goals doesn’t stop you from making costly mistakes when building software. Here are five common software planning and delivery problems that can get in your way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scope Creep&lt;/strong&gt; occurs when you keep adding “just one more feature” until the product you originally set out to build becomes a frankenstein. Products that suffer from scope creep take too long to complete and fail before they’re finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also end up building the &lt;strong&gt;Wrong Solutions&lt;/strong&gt; for the problem you’re solving. Your software features will not contribute to your current business objectives. Over-complicated and over-engineered solutions are telltale signs of wrong solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, you’ll get requests for &lt;strong&gt;Pet Features&lt;/strong&gt; that do not support any of your overall business goals or aren’t necessary for the problem at hand. For example, implementing social login and sharing for B2B software products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you make &lt;strong&gt;Wrong Assumptions&lt;/strong&gt; about what your customers need, you’ll end up implementing solutions that aren’t relevant. To ensure you never implement irrelevant solutions, you need systems that’ll help you spot changing market conditions quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a clear understanding of the business context, it can be difficult to know what you should work on. &lt;strong&gt;Ad-hoc Prioritization&lt;/strong&gt; prevents you from implementing features that have the biggest benefits for your business. You must choose features that significantly reduce your time to market, ans still ensures you meet your business goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can solve all these problems and achieve your business goals by answering just 4 questions before you start a software project. Let’s look at these questions in detail and how they help you make better decisions about your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll figure out what you need in order to build a solution people will gladly pay for. And automagically solve the #2 reason for commercial product failure going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ask-these-4-questions-before-you-build-anything&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask these 4 questions before you build anything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably heard that customers don’t buy drills, they buy holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means when selling anything, you should tell potential customers about how your drill can help them get the hole they’ve always wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s bring that concept to our world of software product development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe that customers buy holes instead of drills…and you take the time to understand your potential customer’s problems better than they do…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…you can ensure the success of your software project from day one by finding people who can’t live without holes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, you can sell them holes even before you start manufacturing drills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you believe your customers build software to accomplish a specific task, you can ensure the success of any software project you work on before you write a line of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how that’d work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you break ground on new software products or add more features to an existing product, you must figure out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-job-to-be-done&quot;&gt;Jobs-To-Be-Done&lt;/a&gt;. Asking these 4 questions will help you map every feature to a specific job that you and your customers want to get done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-1-why-are-we-doing-this&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question #1: Why are we doing this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where you define the problem to be solved, not the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, I told you why businesses that are introducing new products and services fail.
In case you’ve forgotten, it’s because they start with a solution, without first understanding what problems need to be solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answering this question helps you identify true requirements and design better solutions. If you’re building a commercial product, your answer to this question should have a clear link to money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you’re building an A/B testing software, your why could be because you want to help your customers increase conversion rate by 30% within three months of using your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-2-who-are-the-consumers-of-our-product&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question #2: Who are the consumers of our product?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to deliver high-quality products, you must understand who your customers are and what kind of value they are looking for from your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three types of customers for most software products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary customer are the people who get a specific job done by using your software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secondary customers are the people providing the service. That’s you, and everyone on your team who helps your primary customers get stuff done, including your marketing and customer success team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third group of customers have a stake in your business, but don’t actually benefit from your product. These are regulators, consumer protection agencies, and platform owners like Apple and Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to define all three types of customers in order, and what their needs are before you implement features. Your answer to this question should be specific, such as Joanna, the direct response copywriter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-3-how-should-our-customers-behaviour-change&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question #3: How should our customer’s behaviour change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The features you implement in your software products should help your customers change their behavior, especially your primary customers. You’ll focus on activities that your customers must do in order to solve their problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you focus on the behavior changes you hope to achieve with your software, you’ll be able to prioritize which features you must build first. You’ll also spot problems that might prevent your customers from experiencing the full benefits of using your product and build a solution for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing more headlines and call-to-actions is an example of behavior change for users of your A/B testing software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;question-4-what-can-we-do-to-guarantee-results-gor-our-customers&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question #4: What can we do to guarantee results gor our customers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where you finally think about your software deliverables and the things you must do in order to make each of your customers successful, including you, the product owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage, you want to consider all possible solutions to the problems you’ve defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answering this question helps you find the shortest path to changing your customer’s behavior and solving the problems you defined in question #1 because the shortest path may not always be to write custom code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, a 1-on-1 consultation could help your customers achieve the same results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to increase the trial to paid conversion for your A/B testing software, for example, you wouldn’t want to rework the onboarding flow right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, you’d provide a done-for-you service where you’d walk your triers through setting up their first A/B test, improving the chances that they’d stick to your product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Answering all four questions will help you make better roadmap decisions when building your products. You’ll be able to create solutions that make the most impact to each of your customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another benefit of answering these four questions is that, the product owner/founder will have a roadmap for their pre-launch marketing campaigns, including a clear plan for nurturing your customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software developers who don’t avoid the common software planning and delivery problems, and refuse to define the Jobs-To-Be-Done, don’t build remarkable careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to avoid these mistakes, so that you can also ship software products that are robust and uber-profitable, you should read &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/working-with-rails.html&quot;&gt;3 Simple Ways Dropouts Succeed With Rails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
